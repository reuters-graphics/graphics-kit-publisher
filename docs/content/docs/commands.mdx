## Preview

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher preview
```

Build and upload a preview of your project to our testfiles S3 bucket.

## Upload

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher upload
```

Upload your project to the graphics server.

<Aside type="tip">
**In a hurry?** To more quickly upload _just_ the `public` archive -- i.e., the page published on reuters.com, excluding all other embeds or editable editions -- run:

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher upload:quick
```
</Aside>



## Publish

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher publish
```

Publish your project in the graphics server.

## Restart

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher restart
```

Sometimes a graphic pack in the server gets mangled. Run this to remove existing pack IDs and URLs from `package.json`, allowing you to create a new pack next time you upload your project. This command will preserve all other pack metadata previously saved, e.g., titles, descriptions, etc.

<Aside>
As a general rule, if your project hasn't published yet, you should use the [`delete`](#delete) command, which will also clear out all the previous pack's metadata from `package.json`.

If your project _has_ published, that isn't an option, so you can use this command.
</Aside>

## Delete

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher delete
```

If possible, delete a graphic pack in the graphics server and restart the pack.

<Aside>
Projects that have been published in the graphics server **cannot** be deleted.
