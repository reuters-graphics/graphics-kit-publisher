## Preview

Build and upload a preview of your project to our testfiles S3 bucket.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CLI" icon="setting">
    ```console
    pnpm graphics-publisher preview
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Graphics kit" icon="laptop">
    ```console
    pnpm preview
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Upload

Upload your project to the graphics server.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CLI" icon="setting">
    ```console
    pnpm graphics-publisher upload
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Graphics kit" icon="laptop">
    ```console
    pnpm upload
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



<Aside type="tip">
**In a hurry?** To more quickly upload _just_ the `public` archive -- i.e., the page published on reuters.com, excluding all other embeds or editable editions -- run:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="CLI" icon="setting">
  ```console
  pnpm graphics-publisher upload:quick
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Graphics kit" icon="laptop">
  ```console
  pnpm upload:quick
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Aside>



## Publish

Publish your project in the graphics server.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CLI" icon="setting">
    ```console
    pnpm graphics-publisher publish
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Graphics kit" icon="laptop">
    ```console
    pnpm pub
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Restart

Sometimes a graphic pack in the server gets mangled. Run this to remove existing pack IDs and URLs from `package.json`, allowing you to create a new pack next time you upload your project. This command will preserve all other pack metadata previously saved, e.g., titles, descriptions, etc.

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher restart
```

<Aside>
As a general rule, if your project hasn't published yet, you should use the [`delete`](#delete) command, which will also clear out all the previous pack's metadata from `package.json`.

If your project _has_ published, that isn't an option, so you can use this command.
</Aside>

## Delete

If possible, delete a graphic pack in the graphics server and restart the pack.

```console
pnpm graphics-publisher delete
```


<Aside>
Projects that have been published in the graphics server **cannot** be deleted.
