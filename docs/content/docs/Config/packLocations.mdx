Pack locations tell the publisher how to find the parts of your graphics pack from your local file system, usually after your project has been built.

## packLocations.dotcom

- **Type:**
  ```typescript
  string | false
  ```
- **Default:**
  ```typescript
  'dist/'
  ```

Path from project root to a directory where HTML files for dotcom pages are built. There must be a root `index.html` in this directory.

Set to `false` if the project has no dotcom pages.

## packLocations.embeds

- **Type:**
  ```typescript
  string | false
  ```
- **Default:**
  ```typescript
  'dist/embeds/{locale}/{slug}/'
  ```

Path pattern from project root to capture all directories where files for embeddable pages are built. There must be a root `index.html` in each directory found.

Path should include capture groups for the edition's `locale` and `slug`, which must be defined in the directory path. 

For example, setting to `dist/embeds/{locale}/{slug}/`:

```typescript
// publisher.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-kit-publisher';

export default defineConfig({
  packLocations: {
    embeds: 'dist/embeds/{locale}/{slug}/'
  },
});
```

... would capture the following editions from your local file system:

<FileTree>
- dist
  - embeds
    - en \{locale}
      - page \{slug}
        - index.html
      - map \{slug}
        - index.html
    - de \{locale}
      - map \{slug}
        - index.html
</FileTree>

Set to `false` if the project has no embeddable pages.

## packLocations.statics

- **Type:**
  ```typescript
  string | false
  ```
- **Default:**
  ```typescript
  'media-files/{locale}/{slug}/'
  ```

Path from project root to all directories where static files for embeddable graphics are saved. There must be *at least* one static file in the root of each directory. Valid static files include `.eps`, `.jpg`, `.png` or `.pdf`.

Path should include capture groups for the edition's `locale` and `slug`, which must be defined in the directory path. 

For example, setting to `media-files/{locale}/{slug}/`:

```typescript
// publisher.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-kit-publisher';

export default defineConfig({
  packLocations: {
    statics: 'media-files/{locale}/{slug}/'
  },
});
```

... would capture the following editions from your local file system:


<FileTree>
- media-files
  - en \{locale}
    - map \{slug}
      - map.eps EPS edition
      - map.jpg JPG edition
  - de \{locale}
    - map \{slug}
      - map.jpg JPG edition
      - map.pdf PDF edition
</FileTree>

Set to `false` if the project has no static files.
