A filesystem-based publisher for Reuters Graphics projects.

## Why this?

Reuters Graphics projects are packaged for both [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/) readers and media clients through [Reuters Connect](https://www.reutersconnect.com/). The structure each graphics pack needs to conform to is defined by our Sphinx Graphics Server, and it is [complex](/graphics-kit-publisher/sphinx/). This package exists to help compile graphics packs for our server in a way that works across different page builders.

Each graphics pack may consist of any number of public pages for dotcom readers and/or embeddable graphics for media clients. The publisher needs to be able to flex with each project and bundle all the outputs the right way.

We do that by presuming a certain _filesystem structure_ that the graphics publisher knows how to pack up for the graphics server. That makes it a good match for page builders that use filesystem-based routing, namely [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and gives us a publishing tool that makes very few assumptions about the way projects are built as long as they output a pattern of files.
