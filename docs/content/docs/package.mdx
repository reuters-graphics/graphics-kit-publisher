After uploading your project, pack metadata from the graphics server is saved in your project's `package.json` -- most under the `"reuters"` key.

```json
// package.json
{
  "reuters": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane.doe@thomsonreuters.com"
    },
    "graphic": {
      "pack": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "desk": "london",
      "slugs": {
        "root": "ROOT-SLUG",
        "wild": "WILD"
      },
      "title": "A title",
      "description": "A description",
      "authors": [
        {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "link": "https://www.reuters.com/authors/jane-doe/"
        }
      ],
      "published": "2025-02-23T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updated": "2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z",
      "archives": {
        "public": {
          "url": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/.../",
          "title": "A title",
          "description": "A description",
          "uploaded": "2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "media-en-page": {
          "url": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/.../",
          "title": "A title",
          "description": "A description",
          "uploaded": "2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "media-de-map": {
          "title": "A title",
          "description": "A description",
          "uploaded": "2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
      }
    },
    "preview": "https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/.../"
  },
  "homepage": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/.../"
}
```

Most of this data is directly editable in your `package.json`. Changes will update the pack in the graphics server when uploaded.

That said, you probably shouldn't edit things like the `"pack"` ID or `"homepage"` URL unless you're sure you know what you're doing. (For example, abandoning a malformed graphics pack and creating a new one.)
