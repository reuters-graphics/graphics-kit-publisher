# ðŸ“¦ graphics-kit-publisher

A filesystem-based publisher for Reuters Graphics projects.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40reuters-graphics%2Fgraphics-kit-publisher.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40reuters-graphics%2Fgraphics-kit-publisher) [![Reuters open source software](https://badgen.net/badge/Reuters/open%20source/?color=ff8000)](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/)

## Why this?

Reuters Graphics projects are packaged for both reuters.com readers and media clients. The structure each graphics pack needs to conform to is defined by our RNGS server, and it is [complex](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit/issues/1). This package exists to help compile graphics packs for our server in a way that works across different page builders.

Each graphics pack may consist of any number of public pages for dotcom readers and embeddable graphics for media clients. The publisher needs to be able to flex with each project and bundle all the outputs the right way.

We do that by presuming a certain _filesystem structure_ that the graphics-publisher knows how to pack up for the RNGS server. That makes it a good match for page builders that use filesystem-based routing, namely [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and gives us a publishing tool that makes very few assumptions about the way projects are built as long as they output a pattern of files.

## Filesystem structure

The publisher assumes certain things about the structure of your development environment.

#### dist directory (`distDir`)

A dist directory is the output from your page builder.

- The dist directory has an `index.html` file at its root, which includes an `og:image` metatag (used to create a preview image for the graphics pack).
- All static assets are included in a separate root-level directory inside the dist folder, e.g., `cdn/` below, and are absolutely referenced from any HTML page in the project.
- All embeddable graphic pages are contained in a root-level directory named `embeds/` and placed in folders representing a valid locale code and a unique slug within that locale, e.g., `en/chart/index.html` below.
- Additional pages can be named whatever they need to be as long as they don't collide with `embeds` or the static assets directory.

```
dist/
  cdn/
    js/ ...
    css/ ...
    images/ ...
  index.html
  a-second-page/
    index.html
  embeds/
    en/
      chart/
        index.html
```

#### pack directory (`packDir`)

A directory will be created containing the different `zip` archives used to build out your graphics pack.

```
graphics-pack/
  public.zip
  media-en-chart.zip
  media-en-map.zip
```

See [this issue](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit/issues/1#issuecomment-812350299) for more information on the structure of the files sent to the RNGS server.

#### media assets directory (`assetsDir`)

The media assets directory contains flat JPG and EPS files that will be included with the media editions uploaded to the server. They must be structured using the same directory scheme as embeds in the dist directory -- a folder for a valid locale and for a unique slug within the locale. The JPG and EPS filenames can be whatever you want them to be.

```
media-assets/
  en/
    chart/
      chart.eps
      chart.jpg
    map/
      my-map.eps
      map-preview.jpg
```

If you have an embeddable page using the same locale/slug scheme as a set of flat assets, the publisher will upload the JPG and EPS file _with_ the embeddable version of the same graphic.

```
dist/
  embeds/
    en/
      chart/
        index.html
media-assets/
  en/
    chart/
      chart.eps
      chart.jpg
graphics-pack/
  media-en-chart.zip  ðŸ‘ˆ Contains both embeddable graphic and flats 
```

#### locales directory (`localesDir`)

The locales directory contains structured data used to translate the content of your page. The publisher assumes this directory has sub-directories named using a valid locale code, including at least the default locale code for the pack (`packLocale`, usually `'en'`).

Otherwise, the publisher assumes one JSON file (`packMetadataFile`) within this default locale sub-directory contains a title (`packTitleProp`) and description (`packDescriptionProp`) for the pack.

```
locales/
  en/
    content.json
```

#### images directory (`imagesDir`)

An images directory contains at least the share image referenced in the metatag in the root `index.html` file in the dist directory.

```
src/
  statics/
    images/
      share-card.jpg
```

The publisher will create a `manifest.json` file in the root of the images directory with dimensions for every image in that directory. You can use it to set the dimensions of images in your project.

#### package.json

The publisher will fill out your [homepage](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#homepage) prop in package.json with the URL where the root `index.html` file in the dist directory will be served from when it's published through the RNGS server.

It will also fill out a `reuters` prop with metadata about the RNGS graphics pack.

#### build scripts

The publisher assumes two npm [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts) will be defined in your package.json.

The `build` script will run your page builder, which should build the pages and assets in the dist directory. It will be run during the publisher's `upload` command.

The `build:preview` will be run during the publisher's `preview` command.

#### Reuters Graphics user profiles

The publisher assumes you have two user profiles in your computer's home directory.

The `~/.reuters-graphics/graphics-server.json` file contains the following credentials to grant access to the RNGS server API.

```javascript
{
  "username": "<employee ID>",
  "password": "<RNGS API password>",
  "apiKey": "<RNGS API key>"
}
```

The `~/.reuters-graphics/profile.json` file contains your personal profile.

```javascript
{
  "name": "<your name>",
  "email": "<Thomson Reuters email address>",
  "url": "<Twitter URL or another link>",
  "desk": "<graphics desk location>",
  "github": {
    "email": "<GitHub email>"
  }
}
```
